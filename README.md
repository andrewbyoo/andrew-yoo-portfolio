## Description
This website is about myself which includes a short biography, portfolio, contact and social media links, and a contact form.

## User Story

```
As an employer, I want to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples so that I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.
```

## Deployed web page visual
This website is to be used as my first portfolio website with the hover effect for the deployed link shown on Project 4.
